    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Define a fair partitioning of a polygon as a partition of it into a finite number of
        pieces so that every piece has both the same area and the same perimeter. If all
        the resulting pieces are convex, call it a fair convex partitioning. Given any positive
        integer <em>n</em>, can any convex polygon be convex fair partitioned into <em>n</em> pieces?</p>
    <p>
        This problem is easy to grasp and can be solved through some clever intuition.
        It doesn't seem to have any applications but its analogy in 3 dimensions does make for a problem that can be used for practical industrial purposes.
        The problem can also have applications in topology or areas of mathematics that involve equally partitioning a domain of numbers.

        This problem was first asked by R. Nandakumar and N. Ramana Rao[3] in 2008.
        They introduced the idea of fair convex partitions of polygons and proposed that it
        is possible to divide a polygon fairly for any number of partitions.
        Later on, they provided proofs for <em>n</em> = 2 and <em>n</em> = 4 and discuss proofs for higher powers of 2.
        Later, a paper written by Bogdan Armaselu and Ovidiu Daescuthat describes a method for finding fair partitions when <em>n</em> = 2<sup>k</sup>
