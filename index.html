        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Define a fair partitioning of a polygon as a partition of it into a finite number of
            pieces so that every piece has both the same area and the same perimeter. If all
            the resulting pieces are convex, call it a fair convex partitioning. <br />
            Given any positive integer <em>n</em>, can any convex polygon be convex fair partitioned into <em>n</em> pieces ?</p>
        <p>
            This problem is easy to grasp and can be solved through some clever intuition.
            It doesn't seem to have any applications but its analogy in 3 dimensions does make for a problem that can be used for practical industrial purposes.
            The problem can also have applications in topology or areas of mathematics that involve equally partitioning a domain of numbers.
        </p>
        <p>
            This problem was first asked by R. Nandakumar and N. Ramana Rao in 2008.
            They introduced the idea of fair convex partitions of polygons and proposed that it
            is possible to divide a polygon fairly for any number of partitions.
            Later on, they provided proofs for <em>n</em> = 2 and <em>n</em> = 4 and discuss proofs for higher powers of 2.
            Later, a paper written by Bogdan Armaselu and Ovidiu Daescuthat describes an algorithm for finding fair partitions when <em>n</em> = 2 and <em>n</em> = 2<sup>k</sup>.
        </p>

        <h2>Proof for <em>n</em> = 2</h2>
        <p>
            We need to make the assumption that any convex polygon has a line segment that
            passes through it, dividing it into 2 pieces of equal areas. Let a line segment with
            endpoints <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em>, divide the polygon into 2 pieces called <em>L</em> and <em>R</em>, the left and
            right pieces. Here <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em> lie on the boundary of the polygon.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Images/1.png" alt="Example of fair partitioning for n = 2" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            Assume that the perimeter of <em>L</em> is greater than the perimeter of <em>R</em>. 
            Now, we slowly rotate this segment in anti-clockwise direction,
            maintaining the areas on both side. Because we are moving <em>P1</em> and <em>P2</em> continuously,
            the perimeters of <em>L</em> and <em>R</em> are also changing continuously.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Images/example.gif" alt="Continous change of L and R" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point <em>P1</em> will reach the original position of <em>P2</em>, while <em>P2</em> will reach the
            original position of <em>P1</em>. But in this case the perimeter of <em>L</em> is now smaller than the
            perimeter of <em>R</em>. This implies that at some point in the rotation, both perimeters of
            <em>L</em> and <em>R</em> must have been equal. Therefore, it is possible to obtain a fair partition of
            a convex polygon for <em>n</em> = 2.
        </p>
        <h2>Algorithmic approach for <em>n</em> = 2</h2>
        <p>
            The algorithm tries to find a fair partition by first finding a single area bisector
            of the polygon that divides the polygon into its left and right parts. Once it
            has the area bisector, it is rotated around the polygon until both the left and
            right parts have equal perimeters too. This will give us a fair partition that
            divides the polygon into 2 fair pieces.<br />
            The computation time is <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>).
        </p>


        <h3>Finding the area bisector</h3>
        <p>
            To find the first area bisector, the polygon is triangulated.
            Looking at each triangle boundary from left to right, find the boundary at
            which the area of the triangles on the left side becomes greater than the ones
            on the right side. When this happens we know that the area bisector lies
            somewhere between the current boundary and the previous one.
        </p>

            <img src="/Images/3.png" alt="Line e splits P into P1 and P2, line L is an area bisector of P" style="width:400px;height:400px;">
        </p>
        <h3>Updating the area bisector</h3>
        <p>
            Once we have an area bisector <em>L</em> with endpoints <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, we need to update it
            till the left and right pieces have the same perimeter. There are 4 possibilities for the new area bisector.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Images/4.png" alt="Possibilities for the new area bisector(1)" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="/Images/5.png" alt="Possibilities for the new area bisector(2)" style="width:800px;height:400px;">
        </p>
        <p>
            In each of case, we find the difference in perimeters between the left and right
            sides and update the area bisector to the one with the least difference. To find
            the 4 area bisectors we do something similar to what we did to find <em>q</em>.
        </p>


        <h2>Algorithmic approach for <em>n</em> = 2<sup>k</sup></h2>
        <p>
            To find the pieces for <em>n</em> = 2<sup>k</sup>, we apply the
            algorithm for finding <em>n</em> = 2 recursively for each of the partitions.<br />
            The computation time is <em>O</em>((2<em>n</em>)<em><sup>k</sup>)</em>.
